# Introduction to Human Information Processing GitHub project

Hi, I am Noah Scales, the creator of this project. The project stores my thoughts on human epistemology, inference and related topics. My purpose in publishing this documentation is share my understandings of human learning, intelligence and inference. 

# The conclusions of this project

It might seem odd to give the conclusions of a research project in the README, but I recognize that we are all busy people.

## The list of conclusions of the project

The list of conclusions of this research project include:

1. **Human knowledge builds cumulatively, incrementally, and collectively.** Civilization carries human knowledge forward and allows its propagation and use among people. Intuitively, we rely on knowledge accumulated from other people. Well, so do those other people. If you trace the history of that accumulation backward, you can see incremental and cumulative knowledge contributions spanning thousands of years and carried to the present by civilizational products. The development of civilization and the knowledge it provides humans occurs over many generations of humans. The unevenly distributed accumulation of knowledge captured in a snapshot of time during a civilization's life cannot be attributed to "key figures" who "shaped civilization". Rather, it reflects the causal influences of billions of people over many generations, affecting not just knowledge production among individuals, but also knowledge capture and storage in civilizational knowledge-bases and the later access of those knowledge bases. 
2. **Individual human cognitive capacity relies on cognitive aids to demonstrate what we popularly call "intelligence".** We increase our effective cognitive capacity through external cognitive aids, tools or helpers that assist human knowledge, memory, imagination or attention. A knowledge base is an example of a cognitive aid and can be as simple as someone's diary or as complicated as the internet. Civilizational affordances remain necessary for access to that knowledge (for example, reading education). However, the original cognitive aids were other people.

3. **Errors in individual cognitive output are due to limitations of available knowledge, memory, imagination, or attention.** While knowledge can come from any source, including ongoing experience or imagination, processing of it by humans relies on at least one of memory, imagination and attention. If the source of the error is not the knowledge itself, then it is the human processing of it.
